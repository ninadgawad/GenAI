# GenAI
GenAI, or Generative AI, is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content like text, images, music, and videos, rather than just analyzing or categorizing existing data. 
It learns from vast datasets and uses algorithms to generate original material based on patterns it identifies. 

GenAI utilizes deep learning models, like large language models (LLMs) such as those in OpenAI's GPT series, or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for images.
These models are trained on massive datasets to identify patterns and structures.
When given a prompt, the model uses these learned patterns to predict and generate new content that mirrors the characteristics of its training data.
