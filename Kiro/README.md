## Kiro

A new agentic IDE that works alongside you from prototype to production

### Kiro specs 
These are artifacts that prove useful anytime you need to think through a feature in-depth, refactor work that needs upfront planning, or when you want to understand the behavior of systemsâ€”in short, most things you need to get to production. Requirements are usually uncertain when you start building, which is why developers use specs for planning and clarity. Specs can guide AI agents to a better implementation in the same way.

### Kiro hooks 
They act like an experienced developer catching things you miss or completing boilerplate tasks in the background as you work. These event-driven automations trigger an agent to execute a task in the background when you save, create, delete files, or on a manual trigger.


### Sample Ask
1. Start
```
Help create a Testing MCP Server which generates a Functional test case using Playwright MCP server as base for any given reactjs project and helps generate the script to configure and run the playwright scripts. Design this MCP server which can be shared with all the team member which can help generate functional test cases for there individual reactjs application, the test structure of the folder must be under tests/functional/e2e  
```

2. Refine
```
How add MCP resource and prompts to make sure the test scripts are as per the company standards, generate a sample markdown file to create a sample company standars and Jenkins server configuration to run the scripts as part of CI/CD. Suggest ideas to make it customizable for different types of Ci/CD
```

3. Fix
```
How do I fix the following problem in the above code?: Cannot find module './tools/config-generator.js' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

4. Enhance
```
Review the code and create a technical design document and user guide on how to use this testing MCP servcer. Create these in Markdown format
```
